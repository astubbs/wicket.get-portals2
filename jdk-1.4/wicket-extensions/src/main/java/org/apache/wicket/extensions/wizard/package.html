<title>wicket.extensions.wizard package</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>
Package for working with Wizard components. Wizards are dialogs which take
users through a number of steps to acchieve something.
<p>
The main component is <tt>wicket.extensions.wizard</tt>, which serves as
the panel on which the whole wizard is rendered. It is possible to implement</p>
<tt>wicket.extensions.wizard.IWizard</tt> directly, but it is not recommended.
The wizard cooperates with an instance of <tt>wicket.extensions.wizard.IWizardModel</tt>,
for which the default implementation <tt>wicket.extensions.wizard.WizardModel</tt> is
provided. This model knows about the wizard's steps and the transitions between them,
and it holds a reference to the currently active step. It might function as a generic
state holder for the wizard too, though you might find it more convenient to use the
wizard component itself for that, or even an external model. See the wizard example
of the wicket-examples project for some examples of wizards.

The <a href="https://wizard-framework.dev.java.net/">Swing Wizard Framework</a>
served as a valueable source of inspiration as did discussions with 
<a href="http://superinterface.com/easywizard.htm">Michael Jouravlev</a> and 
<a href="http://weblogs.java.net/blog/timboudreau/">Tim Boudreau</a>.
