/**
 * Interface representing object that can locate a spring context. The implementation should take up
 * little room when serialized.
 * 
 * SpringObjectLocator uses this interface to locate the spring context so that it in turn can
 * locate a bean.
 * 
 * Ideal implementations use a static lookup to locate the context.
 * 
 * For Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class SpringContextLocator implements ISpringContextLocator
 * {
 * 	public ApplicationContext getSpringContext()
 * 	{
 * 		//MyApplication is the subclass of WebApplication used by the application
 * 		return ((MyApplication)Application.get()).getContext();
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
