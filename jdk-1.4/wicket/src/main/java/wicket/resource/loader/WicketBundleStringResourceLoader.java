/**
 * Wicket's default string resource loaders are NOT behaving like Java Bundles
 * in the sense that once a proper properties files has been found but it does
 * not contain the key you are looking for, Wicket will not continue iterating
 * over the remaing properties file for the same class to check any of these
 * contain the key. 
 * The reason why Java's BundleResource can not be used is because with Wicket
 * the locale, the style and the variation must be evaluated as well. 
 * <p>
 * This ResourceLoader is a all in one. It first tries to resolve through the 
 * class that is given with all the possible style and location variations.
 * Then if still not found it will fall back on the Applications class and tries
 * to load the resources through that one.
 * <p>
 * E.g.
 * <pre>
 * 1) Application_myskin_fi.properties
 *      message1=AAAAAAAAA
 * 2) Application_myskin.properties
 *      message2=BBBBBBBB
 * 3) Application.properties
 *      message3=CCCCCCC
 * </pre>
 * Component.getString("message3") should correctly read from file 3.
 * 
 * TODO Post 1.2: This should become Wicket's default behavior
