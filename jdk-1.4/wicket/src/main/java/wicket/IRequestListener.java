/**
 * Base interface for all interfaces that listen for requests from the client
 * browser. All sub-interfaces of this interface must have a single method which
 * takes no arguments.
 * <p>
 * New listener interfaces must be registered with Wicket by constructing a
 * {@link RequestListenerInterface} object for the given interface class. The
 * best way to do this is to create a public static final constant field in your
 * request listener interface. Doing this will cause the interface to
 * automatically register whenever it is used. For example, see
 * {@link wicket.IRedirectListener#INTERFACE}.
