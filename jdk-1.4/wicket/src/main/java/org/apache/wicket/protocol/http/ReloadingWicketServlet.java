/**
 * Custom WicketServlet that reloads the web applications when classes are
 * modified. In order to reload your own classes, use include and exclude
 * patterns using wildcards. And in web.xml, point to the reloading wicket
 * servlet instead of the original one.
 * 
 * <p>
 * <b>Example denoting the built-in patterns:</b>
 * 
 * <pre>
 * public class MyServlet extends ReloadingWicketServlet
 * {
 * 	static
 * 	{
 * 		ReloadingClassLoader.excludePattern(&quot;org.apache.wicket.*&quot;);
 * 		ReloadingClassLoader.includePattern(&quot;org.apache.wicket.examples.*&quot;);
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see ReloadingWicketFilter for complete documentation, and for proper
 *      integration with Spring
