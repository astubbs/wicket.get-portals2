/**
 * <p>
 * The request cycle processor is responsible for handling the steps of a
 * request cycle. It's methods are called in a pre-defined order:
 * <ul>
 * <li> {@link #resolve(RequestCycle, RequestParameters)} is called to get the
 * request target. A request might refer to e.g. a bookmarkable page, a listener
 * interface call on a component on a previously rendered page, a shared
 * resource or e.g. a non-org.apache.wicket resource that resides in the web application
 * folder. </li>
 * <li> {@link #processEvents(RequestCycle)} is called after the target is
 * resolved. It is meant to handle/ distribute events like e.g. listener
 * interface calls on components. During this processing, the request target may
 * be changed (e.g. by calling setResponsePage). What actually happens is that
 * {@link org.apache.wicket.RequestCycle} holds a stack of targets, of which it will take
 * to last addition as the recent one, but walks the whole stack in order to do
 * cleaning up after the request is handled.</li>
 * <li> {@link #respond(RequestCycle)} is called to create a response to the
 * requesting client. Typically, the actual response handling is to be (or
 * delegated) by the request target implementation, but different strategies
 * might do as they seem fit. </li>
 * <li> {@link #respond(RuntimeException, RequestCycle)} is called whenever an
 * uncaught exception occurs during the event handling or response phase so that
 * an appropriate exception response can be generated. This method is guaranteed
 * to be called whenever such an exception happens, but will never be called
 * otherwise. </li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
