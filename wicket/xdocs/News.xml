			<subsection name="August 30, 2005 - Wicket 1.1-beta 4 Available">
				<p>
					Wicket 1.1-beta 4 is available for download and testing. This is a beta release, so
					you may expect some API changes. We are busy in the end game before we freeze the API,
					and running behind on our published schedule for 1.1 final. In order to be able to ship
					1.1 final soon, we need your testing support!
					Most notable features in this release are:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Removed the (optional) dependency on commons-fileupload, made the support internal for Wicket</li>
					<li>Made the coupling of Wicket to the servlet spec more loose, enabling usage of Wicket on platforms outside a servlet container, such as portlets, or embedded servers</li>
					<li>Stripping of markup in Wicket namespace (e.g. wicket:id, wicket:label) is almost complete with <code>setStripWicketTag(true)</code></li>
					<li>Invisible components are not rendered any more</li>
					<li>Added basic AJAX support: DOJO and script.aculo.us libraries are now available for experimentation.</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					A minor bugfix release has been issued for PageableListViewNavigation.
					The 1.0.3 version doesn't have any other improvements or fixes.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you are using Wicket 1.0 and use the <code>PageableListViewNavigation</code> or
					the <code>PageableListViewNavigator</code>, then we advise you to upgrade to this
					version. Note that when you upgrade from 1.0.1, you may experience some backwards
					incompatibilities, as outlined in the 1.0.2 release notes.

				</p>
				<ul>
				<li>Component developers can now initialize resources when the app starts up</li>

			<subsection name="August 22, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.2 Available">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team has released the second maintenance release of the
					Wicket 1.0 branch. This release fixes some bugs, and with that introduces one
					<strong>API breaking change</strong>:
					<ul>
						<li>newChoiceItem does not use object parameter but selects directly from list Issue: 1263892. Thanks to Arjan Zwaan.</li>
						<li>Backport: AbstractDetachableModel doesn't propogate attach/detach Issue: 1253113.</li>
						<li>Backport: serialization bug in LocalizedImageResource</li>
						<li>Backport: possible NullPointerException in DynamicImageResource.getResourceStream()</li>
						<li>Backport: catch if session is saved to disk and reloaded again but locale is changed</li>
						<li>fix for classloading problems that caused problems loading markup/resources for components that were loaded by another classloader than the current one.</li>
						<li>Backport: closed FileOutputStream in wicket.util.file.Files in finally block</li>
					</ul>
					The API change involves the <code>IResourceStreamLocator</code> interface, where the
					<code>locate</code> method now takes a <code>ClassLoader</code> as an extra parameter. 
					Passing in <code>null</code> will use the context classloader.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="August 1, 2005 - Wicket 1.1-beta 2 Available">
				<p>
					Wicket 1.1-beta 2 is available for download and testing. This is a beta release, so
					you may expect some API changes. Most notable features in this release are:
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript support</li>

						<li>Markup inheritence</li>
						<li>Experimental AJAX support</li>
						<li>Improved URL handling</li>

						<li>Improved Feedback support</li>
						<li>Thread safe validation (bug fix)</li>
						<li>Immediate button support for Forms</li>

				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="July 24, 2005 - Wicket 1.1-beta 1 Avaliable">
				<p>
					Wicket 1.1-beta 1 is available for download and testing. This is a
					beta release, which means that API's might change. Most notable features
					in this release are:
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript support - components can now contribute their own JavaScript to a page, opening up possibilities for very rich Wicket components.</li>
						<li>CSS support - alongside with the JavaScript support, Wicket allows components to contribute their CSS to a page</li>
						<li>Markup inheritence - Wicket pages were already able to inherit on the Java side, but now it is possible to 'constrain' the markup of sub pages to a certain place in the markup. If you thought that borders were difficult, this will make your life very easy!</li>
						<li>Date picker - as a demonstrator for what you can do with our new JavaScript support, we have included a Date picker component in the <em>wicket extensions</em> package.</li>
						<li>Component reference examples - an ongoing concern: documentation and component reference. We have started building small component examples in the Wicket examples project.</li>
					</ul>
					Please download this release and give us feedback on how you like these new features. A final 1.1 release will be available around begin september, so we <em>need your feedback!</em>

					to incorporate the latests Wicket maintenance release.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="July 17, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.1 available">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team has released the first (and probably last)
					maintenance release of Wicket 1.0. This release fixes some bugs and adds
					some missing functionality:
					<ul>
						<li>Only validate components that are visible</li>
						<li>FeedbackPanel: made some methods that were not meant for overriding final, and added methods that make extending feedbackpanel easier</li>
						<li>fixed bug in AbstractPropertyModel which gave problems using custom converters (overriding getConverter for a component) with compound property models</li>
						<li>ComponentStringResourceLoader: resources are now inherited from parent classes when components have been subclassed</li>
					</ul>
					Enjoy!
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="June 7, 2005 - Wicket 1.0 available for download">

			<subsection name="June 5, 2005 - Wicket 1.0 released">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team is proud to announce the launch of Wicket 1.0.
					Wicket is a component based, Java web application framework which seeks to
					ease and simplify web application development.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="May 28, 2005 - Wicket on JavaOne 2005 / San Francisco">
				<p>
					Come see Wicket on JavaOne this summer. Wicket is featured in two events:
					<ul>
					<li><a href="https://www28.cplan.com/javaone05_93_1/session_details.jsp?isid=271617&amp;ilocation_id=93-1&amp;ilanguage=english" title="TS-8617">TS-8617 POJO Web Development With Wicket</a> -

			</subsection>
			<subsection name="May 21, 2005 - 1.0 RC3 is out!">
				<p>
					Finally, after a month of some silence, we have produced our last release
					candidate before we deploy 1.0. If all goes well, you will see the final
					release within a week or two. The bug list now only contains an issue
					relating to clustering. As such we advise you currently to not deploy your
					application on a cluster, until the issues are resolved, or to be very thorough
					in your clustering tests.
				</p>
				<p>
					In this release you won't see major API changes, however the internals have
					improved significantly. The request cycle has now correct semantics, we have
					improved the redirect after post pattern, which now performs significantly
					better than before, and allows you to do your request handling and rendering
					in one pass, and then redirect to the rendered page. CompoundModel support has
					improved and works with more components than before. We added support for 
					redirecting to external url's (e.g. Google) directly by introducing RedirectPage.
				</p>

					The Wicket team is preparing the final Wicket 1.0 release candidate. Therefore
					we need your help. If you have things that are hard for you to accomplish using
					Wicket, if there is something you posted to the mailinglist and it didn't get
					resolved, if you have a killer idea that absolutely must be in 1.0 or else...
				</p>
				<p>Send it to the mailinglist or create a bug report!</p>
				<p>
					The Wicket team want the RC3 to be the final release for Wicket 1.0. After this,

			<subsection name="April 3, 2005 - 1.0 RC1 is released!">

					<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1_0-rc1">
						changelog

				</p>
				<p>A list of the most note worthy changes:</p>
				<ul>

						<code>id="wcn:foo"</code>
						we now use
						<code>wicket:id="foo"</code>
						.

					<li>Support for clustering</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/apidocs/wicket/model/CompoundPropertyModel.html"><code>CompoundPropertyModel</code></a>
						makes development of forms much easier and less verbose
					</li>
					<li>
						Added factories for creating your own Session, RequestCycle, etc. objects. Many things are configurable in Wicket using factories.

						Moved non-core stuff to the <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a> project.
					</li>

			<subsection name="March 19, 2005 - A new Wicket project is born: Wicket Stuff">
				<p>
					We have registered a
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">seperate project</a>
					for hosting non-core components:
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">Wicket Stuff</a>
					. If your component has a dependency other than the
					<a href="Dependencies.html">Wicket dependencies</a>
					, for example a
					<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
					component, then
					<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a>
					is the place to find it.
				</p>
				<p>The initial list of components hosted there is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sourceforge.net/wicket-velocity-panel">
							Velocity Panel
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>Hibernate components and helpers</li>

			<subsection name="March, 4, 2005 - 0.9.19-beta released">
				<p>
					The releases are getting smaller, so it is nearly that special time for RC1.
					The current release marks the work done between 0.9.18-beta and now. An issue
					regarding dependencies of Wicket has been resolved. Wicket doesn't depend any more
					on difficult to distribute libraries.

			<subsection name="Februari 20, 2005 - 0.9.18-beta released">
				<p>
					The Wicket team has worked really hard to make this beta release possible.
					The march to the big 1.0 is on, and the first release candidate will surface 
					in the next few weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot has changed in this release, so you will receive some compile time errors if you are
					coming from a previous release. Among the changes are the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Added a <a href="faqs.html" title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a> section to our site</li>
						<li>Renamed handleX() methods and other events to conform to the onX() pattern.</li>

						<li>Changed HtmlPage to WebPage, HtmlContainer to WebContainer and HtmlComponent to WebComponent</li>
						<li>Reorganized components and examples for final 1.0 structure.</li>
