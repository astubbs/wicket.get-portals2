				Here is an overview of all Wicket related news items posted on our
				<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net">front page</a>
				.
			</p>
			<subsection name="April 3, 2005 - 1.0 RC1 is released!">
				<p>
					The Wicket team is proud to release the first 1.0 release candidate. This is
					probably the most important milestone in our history. From now on the feature
					list has been frozen, and the bug list will shrink. Please take a look at the
					<a href="http://wicket.sourceforge.net/changes-report.html#1_0-rc1">
						changelog
					</a>
					for this release.
				</p>
				<p>A list of the most note worthy changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Addition of Wicket namespace for identifying components: instead of
						<code>id="wcn:foo"</code>
						we now use
						<code>wicket:id="foo"</code>
						.
					</li>
					<li>Support for clustering</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/apidocs/wicket/model/CompoundPropertyModel.html"><code>CompoundPropertyModel</code></a>
						makes development of forms much easier and less verbose
					</li>
					<li>
						Added factories for creating your own Session, RequestCycle, etc. objects. Many things are configurable in Wicket using factories.
					</li>
					<li>
						Moved non-core stuff to the <a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a> project.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="April 3, 2005 - Live Examples">
				<p>
					Juergen Donnerstag has created a
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples">live examples</a>
					website for everyone to see what can be done with Wicket without having to
					deploy the examples yourself!
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples">live examples</a>
					are hosted on the
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/">Wicket Library</a>
					, which will be
					<strong>the</strong>
					marketplace for (third party) Wicket components.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="March 30, 2005 - Two articles on the wiki">
				<p>Jonathan Locke has written two articles on using Wicket:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=models">Working with Wicket Models</a>
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="/wiki/doku.php?id=lifecycle">
							The Lifecycle of a Wicket Application
						</a>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="March 19, 2005 - A new Wicket project is born: Wicket Stuff">
				<p>
					We have registered a
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">seperate project</a>
					for hosting non-core components:
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">Wicket Stuff</a>
					. If your component has a dependency other than the
					<a href="Dependencies.html">Wicket dependencies</a>
					, for example a
					<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
					component, then
					<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a>
					is the place to find it.
				</p>
				<p>The initial list of components hosted there is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sourceforge.net/wicket-velocity-panel">
							Velocity Panel
						</a>
					</li>
					<li>Hibernate components and helpers</li>
					<li>Groovy integration</li>
					<li>Spring Framework integration</li>
					<li>fValidate integration</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Releases of these projects will come available as Wicket 1.0 RC1 ships.</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="March, 4, 2005 - 0.9.19-beta released">
				<p>
					The releases are getting smaller, so it is nearly that special time for RC1.
					The current release marks the work done between 0.9.18-beta and now. An issue
					regarding dependencies of Wicket has been resolved. Wicket doesn't depend any more
					on difficult to distribute libraries.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Februari 20, 2005 - 0.9.18-beta released">
				<p>
					The Wicket team has worked really hard to make this beta release possible.
					The march to the big 1.0 is on, and the first release candidate will surface 
					in the next few weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot has changed in this release, so you will receive some compile time errors if you are
					coming from a previous release. Among the changes are the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Added a <a href="faqs.html" title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a> section to our site</li>
						<li>Renamed handleX() methods and other events to conform to the onX() pattern.</li>
						<li>Added Button class and Form buttons support. When it has two or more buttons, the onSubmit() handler is called on the button which submitted the Form.</li>
						<li>Changed HtmlPage to WebPage, HtmlContainer to WebContainer and HtmlComponent to WebComponent</li>
						<li>Reorganized components and examples for final 1.0 structure.</li>
					</ul>
