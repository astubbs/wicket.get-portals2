            <p>This quickstart is a small guide to get you up and running to 
                start using Wicket within minutes. Currently only <a 
                href="http://www.eclipse.org">Eclipse</a> is supported, but if 
                you have another IDE you'd like to see quickstart support for, 
                don't hesitate to contribute!</p>
            <subsection name="Summary">
                <p>For the more knowledgeable developers, here's a short list 
                    of steps to quickstart your Wicket development. All these 
                    steps are explained in more detail below.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>download the quickstart project for your IDE (currently 
                        only Eclipse is supported)</li>
                    <li>unzip in your workspace</li>
                    <li>rename directory to project name</li>
                    <li>create new Java project in Eclipse, using previous 
                        project name</li>
                    <li>run the QuickStart class (Run as - Java 
                        application)</li>
                    <li>open browser to <a

        <section name="Setting up">
            <subsection name="Prerequisites">
                <p>We assume you have the following already installed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Java 1.4 (or newer)</li>
                    <li>Eclipse 3.0 (or newer)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>It is assumed, but not obligatory, that you have installed 
                    eclipse in the following (Windows) directory:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>C:\eclipse</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>and that your workspace resides in the default location:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <code>C:\eclipse\workspace</code>
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>Like stated before, it is not obligatory to use these 
                    settings, but if your installation does not match this one, 
                    please substitute your setup for these assumptions.</p>

                <p>Next you need to download the quickstart distribution 
                    project from our sourceforge site.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Download the <a href="">wicket-quickstart 
                        distribution</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Unzip the distribution into your Eclipse workspace (which is 
                    typically located under 
                    <code>C:\eclipse\workspace</code>).</p>
                <p>Rename the directory that was just created to your required 
                    project name. In the following the directory name is 
                    renamed to 'foobar'.</p>

                <p>Now it is time to start Eclipse, if you haven't done so 
                    already. Select the workspace where you have installed the 
                    Wicket quickstart project. In order to have Eclipse import 
                    your project we will create a new Java project using the 
                    directory name of your project.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start the 'New project' wizard in Eclipse. </li>
                    <li>Select 'Java project' and click next.<img 
                        src="images/quickstart-newproject.png"/></li>
                    <li>Enter in the 'project name' box the name of your 
                        directory (chosen in the directory rename action of 
                        before). Notice the text at the bottom of the dialog 
                        saying <blockquote>The specified external location 
                        already exists. If a project is created in this 
                        location, the wizard will automatically try to detect 
                        existing sources and class files and configure the 
                        classpath appropriately.</blockquote><img

            <subsection name="Running the application">
                <p>The application has an internal webserver (<a 
                    href="http://jetty.mortbay.org">Jetty</a>) which can be 
                    used to quickly develop webapplications. All you need to do 
                    is to run the application and point your browser to the 
                    webserver running from within Eclipse.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start the Jetty server by right-clicking on the 
                        <code>src/main/java</code> directory in the project and 
                        selecting the menu: 'Run as - Java application'. If 
                        Eclipse prompts you for a main class, browse to the 
                        class named 'QuickStart'.</li>
                    <li>Start your browser</li>
                    <li>Point the browser to the local Jetty server: <a

                <p>Jetty is started on port 8081 in order to avoid conflicts 
                    with other installed application servers (for instance 
                    Tomcat). This way it is easier to test with different 
                    application servers. This can be configured in the 
                    configuration file.</p>
