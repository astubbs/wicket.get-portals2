				"I think its an awesome way to deal with this whole web UI framework mess. I am
				happy to see someone take a simple and clean approach to the whole problem, and come
				up with a transparent POJO solution. I like the direction the framework is going...
				Wicket is clean, simple and elegant."

				The issue that impressed me in the Wicket model is that "Wicket does not mix markup 
				with Java code and adds no special syntax to your markup files." You reference Wicket 
				identities as HTML attributes and define component properties in Java, which allows 
				designers and programmers to work independently (within the obvious constraint of 
				having common goals). There is no need for special tools.

				"I have used Wicket since last Fall for personal projects. I have 3 kids and a wife so 
				my free-time is very limited. Given that, I had to be very picky about which framework 
				I chose.

				I've been very impressed with how little hassle it has been to start creating powerful, 
				reusable components and pages with Wicket even under rather severe time constraints.

				"...after using web MVC frameworks for a couple of years, building ever more complex
				web applications, I moved to component based frameworks. Of these, I think Wicket is
				by far the best..."
