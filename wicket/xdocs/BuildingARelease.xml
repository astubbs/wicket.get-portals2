            <p>
                <em>NB. This is a work in progress, the document is not 
                    finished yet!</em>
            </p>
            <p> This document outlines the steps needed to perform a succesful 
                release of Wicket on SourceForge. No intimate knowledge of 
                Wicket or maven is required to perform the release if you use 
                this guide, but should be very handy. </p>
            <subsection name="Introduction">
                <p>The steps will use maven as a build tool, as it helps 
                    resolving our dependencies, creating a new website and 
                    ultimately upload and perform a SourceForge release for us 
                    (not implemented yet). </p>
                <p> This document will fall into four parts: </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>preparing the release</li>
                    <li>building the release</li>
                    <li>distributing the release</li>
                    <li>publicizing the release</li>
                </ol>
                <p>The following part of this document describes in detail how 
                    to perform each part of building a Wicket release.</p>

        <section name="Preparing the release">
            <p>This section describes the preparation step to perform a release 
                of the Wicket project.</p>
            <p>In short the following steps are performed, each step will be 
                described in more detail in the rest of this section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>checkout the latest and greatest from CVS</li>
                <ul>

                <li>add a news item to the front page and news archive</li>
                <li>run the unit tests and generate the website locally using

        <section name="Building the release">
            <p>This section describes the building stage to perform a release 
                of the Wicket project.</p>
            <p>In short the following steps are performed, each step will be 
                described in more detail in the rest of this section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>commit all outstanding changes (news items spring to 
                    mind)</li>
                <li>prepare the release using maven</li>
                <li>create the distributable using maven</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Distributing the release">
            <p>This section describes the distribution step to perform a 
                release of the Wicket project. Wicket is downloadable from 
                SourceForge, but also available from the Maven remote 
                repositories. This section describes how to get the Wicket 
                binaries to our users.</p>
            <p>In short the following steps are performed, each step will be 
                described in more detail in the rest of this section:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>upload the distributable to sourceforge</li>
                <li>upload the generated website using maven</li>
                <li>create an upload bundle for ibiblio using maven</li>
                <li>upload the upload bundle to the website</li>
                <li>create an upload request in JIRA for the maven 
                    maintainers</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section name="Publicizing the release">
            <p>This section describes the publication step after a release of 
                the Wicket project is built. No project can survive without 
                users, and the users need to be informed of the release. 
                Various channels are available to publicize our project on, and 
                this section describes how to do this without much effort.</p>
            <p>In short the following steps are performed, each step will be 
                described in more detail in the rest of this section:</p>
