		<section name="Welcome to Wicket">
			<p>
				Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of
				concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked
				up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic
				content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class
				component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted using your
				favourite technology.

			<subsection name="March 19, 2005 - A new Wicket project is born: Wicket Stuff">
				<p>
					We have registered a
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">seperate project</a>
					for hosting non-core components:
					<a href="http://www.sf.net/projects/wicket-stuff">Wicket Stuff</a>
					. If your component has a dependency other than the
					<a href="Dependencies.html">Wicket dependencies</a>
					, for example a
					<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
					component, then
					<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a>
					is the place to find it.
				</p>
				<p>The initial list of components hosted there is:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/velocity">Velocity</a>
						Panel
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.hibernate.org">Hibernate</a>
						components and helpers
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org">Groovy</a>
						integration
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.springframework.org">Spring Framework</a>
						integration
					</li>
					<li>
						<a href="http://www.peterbailey.net/fValidate/">fValidate</a>
						integration
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>Releases of these projects will come available as Wicket 1.0 RC1 ships.</p>

			<subsection name="March 4, 2005 - 0.9.19-beta released">
				<p>
					The releases are getting smaller, so it is nearly that special time for RC1. The
					current release marks the work done between 0.9.18-beta and now. An issue
					regarding dependencies of Wicket has been resolved. Wicket doesn't depend any
					more on difficult to distribute libraries.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Februari 20, 2005 - 0.9.18-beta released">
				<p>
					The Wicket team has worked really hard to make this beta release possible. The
					march to the big 1.0 is on, and the first release candidate will surface in the
					next few weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot has changed in this release, so you will receive some compile time errors
					if you are coming from a previous release. Among the changes are the following:
					<ul>
						<li>
							Added a
							<a href="faqs.html" title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a>
							section to our site
						</li>
						<li>
							Renamed handleX() methods and other events to conform to the onX()
							pattern.
						</li>
						<li>
							Added Button class and Form buttons support. When it has two or more
							buttons, the onSubmit() handler is called on the button which submitted
							the Form.
						</li>
						<li>
							Changed HtmlPage to WebPage, HtmlContainer to WebContainer and
							HtmlComponent to WebComponent
						</li>
						<li>Reorganized components and examples for final 1.0 structure.</li>
					</ul>
