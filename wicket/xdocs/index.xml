		<section name="Welcome to Wicket">
			<p>
				Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of
				concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked
				up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic
				content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class
				component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted using your
				favourite technology.

			<subsection name="April 22, 2005 - Last Call for Wicket 1.0!">
				<p>Wicket needs your input!</p>
				<p>
					The Wicket team is preparing the final Wicket 1.0 release candidate. Therefore
					we need your help. If you have things that are hard for you to accomplish using
					Wicket, if there is something you posted to the mailinglist and it didn't get
					resolved, if you have a killer idea that absolutely must be in 1.0 or else...
				</p>
				<p>Send it to the mailinglist or create a bug report!</p>
				<p>
					The Wicket team want the RC3 to be the final release for Wicket 1.0. After this,
					development will focus on creating 1.1 with full support for AJAX, JavaScript,
					CSS and more.
				</p>
				<p>This is the final call for changes to Wicket 1.0.</p>
				<p>With regards,</p>
				<p>The Wicket Team</p>

					project gives you a head start when you want to begin your own

			<subsection name="April 16, 2005 - 1.0 RC2 is out!">
				<p>
					We are getting close to a final 1.0 release in the near future. This RC2 release
					marks the next milestone on the journey to the first production ready release of
					Wicket. Many of the problems found by RC1 users have been solved and this
					release should be a much smoother ride for all.
				</p>
				<p>
					We also added an RSS feed to the website in order to provide you with the latest
					news through your favorite RSS reader. Check

			<subsection name="April 3, 2005 - 1.0 RC1 is released!">
				<p>
					The Wicket team is proud to release the first 1.0 release candidate. This is
					probably the most important milestone in our history. From now on the feature
					list has been frozen, and the bug list will shrink. Please take a look at the
					<a href="changes-report.html#1_0_0-rc1">changelog</a>
					for this release.
				</p>
				<p>A list of the most noteworthy changes:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						Addition of Wicket namespace for identifying components: instead of
						<code>id="wcn:foo"</code>
						we now use
						<code>wicket:id="foo"</code>
						.
					</li>
					<li>Support for clustering</li>
					<li>
						<code>CompoundPropertyModel</code>
						makes development of forms much easier and less verbose
					</li>
					<li>
						Added factories for creating your own Session, RequestCycle, etc. objects.
						Many things are configurable in Wicket using factories.
					</li>
					<li>
						Moved non-core stuff to the
						<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sf.net">Wicket Stuff</a>
						project.
					</li>
				</ul>

			<subsection name="April 3, 2005 - Live Examples">
				<p>
					Juergen Donnerstag has created a
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples">live examples</a>
					website for everyone to see what can be done with Wicket without having to
					deploy the examples yourself!
				</p>
				<p>
					The
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/wicket-examples">live examples</a>
					are hosted on the
					<a href="http://www.wicket-library.com/">Wicket Library</a>
					, which will be
