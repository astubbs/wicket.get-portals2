		<section name="Welcome to Wicket">
			<p>
				Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of
				concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked
				up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic
				content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class
				component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted with
				Hibernate.

				<p>
					The releases are getting smaller, so it is nearly that special time for RC1.
					The current release marks the work done between 0.9.18-beta and now. An issue
					regarding dependencies of Wicket has been resolved. Wicket doesn't depend any more
					on difficult to distribute libraries.

			<subsection name="Februari 20, 2005 - 0.9.18-beta released">
				<p>
					The Wicket team has worked really hard to make this beta release possible.
					The march to the big 1.0 is on, and the first release candidate will surface 
					in the next few weeks.
				</p>
				<p>
					A lot has changed in this release, so you will receive some compile time errors if you are
					coming from a previous release. Among the changes are the following:
					<ul>
						<li>Added a <a href="faqs.html" title="Frequently Asked Questions">FAQ</a> section to our site</li>
						<li>Renamed handleX() methods and other events to conform to the onX() pattern.</li>
						<li>Added Button class and Form buttons support. When it has two or more buttons, the onSubmit() handler is called on the button which submitted the Form.</li>
						<li>Changed HtmlPage to WebPage, HtmlContainer to WebContainer and HtmlComponent to WebComponent</li>
						<li>Reorganized components and examples for final 1.0 structure.</li>
					</ul>
