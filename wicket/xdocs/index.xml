		<section name="Welcome to Wicket">
			<p>
				Wicket is a Java web application framework that takes simplicity, separation of
				concerns and ease of development to a whole new level. Wicket pages can be mocked
				up, previewed and later revised using standard WYSIWYG HTML design tools. Dynamic
				content processing and form handling is all handled in Java code using a first-class
				component model backed by POJO data beans that can easily be persisted using your
				favourite technology.

			<subsection name="Juli 24, 2005 - Wicket 1.1-beta 1 Avaliable">
				<p>
					Wicket 1.1-beta 1 is available for download and testing. This is a
					beta release, which means that API's might change. Most notable features
					in this release are:
					<ul>
						<li>JavaScript support - components can now contribute their own JavaScript to a page, opening up possibilities for very rich Wicket components.</li>
						<li>CSS support - alongside with the JavaScript support, Wicket allows components to contribute their CSS to a page</li>
						<li>Markup inheritence - Wicket pages were already able to inherit on the Java side, but now it is possible to 'constrain' the markup of sub pages to a certain place in the markup. If you thought that borders were difficult, this will make your life very easy!</li>
						<li>Date picker - as a demonstrator for what you can do with our new JavaScript support, we have included a Date picker component in the <em>wicket extensions</em> package.</li>
						<li>Component reference examples - an ongoing concern: documentation and component reference. We have started building small component examples in the Wicket examples project.</li>
					</ul>
					Please download this release and give us feedback on how you like these new features. A final 1.1 release will be available around begin september, so we <em>need your feedback!</em>

			<subsection name="Juli 17, 2005 - NetBeans kickstart guide available">
				<p>
					Thanks to the writing talents of Geertjan Wielenga, the
					<a href="http://wicket-stuff.sourceforge.net/wicket-kickstart/index.html">Wicket Kickstart</a>
					project now hosts a guide for kickstarting you Wicket development using
					<a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans</a>
					. The project has been updated to incorporate the latests Wicket maintenance
					release.
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Juli 17, 2005 - Maintenance release Wicket 1.0.1 available">
				<p>
					The Wicket development team has released the first (and probably last)
					maintenance release of Wicket 1.0. This release fixes some bugs and adds some
					missing functionality:
					<ul>
						<li>Only validate components that are visible</li>
						<li>
							FeedbackPanel: made some methods that were not meant for overriding
							final, and added methods that make extending feedbackpanel easier
						</li>
						<li>
							fixed bug in AbstractPropertyModel which gave problems using custom
							converters (overriding getConverter for a component) with compound
							property models
						</li>
						<li>
							ComponentStringResourceLoader: resources are now inherited from parent
							classes when components have been subclassed
						</li>
					</ul>
					Enjoy!
