 * This StatelessForm is the same as a normal form but with the statelesshint default to true.
 * The form can be newly constructed when the onSubmit of its form or its buttons is called.
 * So you can't depend on state within the page. The only state you can depend on is what 
 * was submitted from the browser.  So the model of the form or the formcomponents are updated
 * with the submit values.
