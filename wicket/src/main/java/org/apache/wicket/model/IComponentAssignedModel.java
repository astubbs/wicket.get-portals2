/**
 * Models that wish to substitute themselves with a wrapper when they are bound to a component
 * (either through IModel parameter in a constructor or via a call to
 * {@link Component#setDefaultModel(IModel)}) should implement this interface. One reason for a model to
 * want to do this is if it needs to be aware of the component it is bound to.
 * 
 * The algorithm wicket employs is similar to this:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * void Component.setModel(IModel model) 
 * {
 *     if (model instanceof IComponentAssignedModel) 
 *     {
 *        this.model = ((IComponentAssignedModel)model).wrapOnAssignment(this);
 *     } 
 *     else 
 *     {
 *        this.model = model;
 *     }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * For an example see {@link ResourceModel}
