The core Wicket package.  The key core classes you will need to learn to 
do basic Wicket programming are:
<ul>
	<li><b>{@link wicket.Application} / {@link wicket.protocol.http.WebApplication}</b> - Subclass WebApplication to create your application.
	Set your home page with Application.getPages().setHomePage(MyHomePage.class).
	Configure Wicket for deployment with Application.getSettings().configure("deployment").
	Substitute "development" to get default settings for a development environment.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.Component}</b> - You will need to carefully study this class as Component is very 
	central to Wicket.  There are a large number of convenience methods in Component 
	and, naturally, every component in Wicket is a subclass of Component, so all these
	methods are available to all Components.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.IRequestCycleFactory}</b> - If you are working with a persistence framework
	such as Hibernate or JDO, you may need to implement a request cycle factory in order
	to open a persistence session at the beginning of a request and close the session
	at the end of the request.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.ISessionFactory}</b> - For all but the most trivial applications, you will
	need to create your own session factory.  Your implementation of this interface
	will generally be quite simple, generally just returning a new instance of your 
	own application-specific subclass of WebSession.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.MarkupContainer}</b> - You will need to study MarkupContainer carefully as
	this class contains all the logic for creating and maintaining component hierarchies.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.Page} / {@link wicket.markup.html.WebPage}</b> - Every page in your wicket application will extend WebPage
	(or some other subclass of Page if you are writing something other than a web application).
	There are a number of important methods in Page and you should be familiar with all of them.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.PageParameters}</b> - A simple wrapper for query string parameters.
	
	<li><b>{@link wicket.Session} / {@link wicket.protocol.http.WebSession}</b> - It is particularly important to understand Session
	if you are doing clustering, but even for a very basic application you will want
	to create your own subclass of WebSession using a session factory so that you can
	store any session properties in a typesafe way.  Note that since Pages are first
	class objects with models of their own, it is likely or at least possible that you 
	will not have many session properties.
</ul>
