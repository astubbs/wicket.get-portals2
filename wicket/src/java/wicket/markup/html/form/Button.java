/**
 * A form button.
 * <p>
 * Within a form, you can nest Button components. Note that you don't have to do
 * this to let the form work (a simple &lt;input type="submit".. suffices), but
 * if you want to have different kinds of submit behavior it might be a good
 * idea to use Buttons.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The model property is used to set the &quot;value&quot; attribute. It will
 * thus be the label of the button that shows up for end users. If you want the
 * attribute to keep it's markup attribute value, don't provide a model, or let
 * it return an empty string.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When you add a Wicket Button to a form, and that button is clicked, by
 * default the button's onSubmit method is called first, and after that the
 * form's onSubmit method is called. If you want to change this (e.g. you don't
 * want to call the form's onSubmit method, or you want it called before the
 * button's onSubmit method), you can override Form.delegateSubmit.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * One other option you should know of is the 'defaultFormProcessing' property
 * of Button components. When you set this to false (default is true), all
 * validation and formupdating is bypassed and the onSubmit method of that
 * button is called directly, and the onSubmit method of the parent form is not
 * called. A common use for this is to create a cancel button.
 * </p>
