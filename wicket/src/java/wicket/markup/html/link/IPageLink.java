/**
 * Interface that is used to implement delayed page linking. The getPage()
 * method returns an instance of Page when a link is actually clicked (thus
 * avoiding the need to create a destination Page object for every link on a
 * given Page in advance). The getPageIdentity() method returns the subclass of
 * Page that getPage() will return if and when it is called.
 * <p>
 * This way of arranging things is useful in determining whether a link links to
 * a given page, which is in turn useful for deciding how to display the link
 * (because links in a navigation which link to a page itself are not useful and
 * generally should instead indicate where the user is in the navigation).
 * <p>
 * To understand how getPageIdentity() is used in this way, take a look at the
 * Link.linksTo() method and its override in PageLink. Also, see the
 * documentation for getPageIdentity() below.

	 * Gets the class of the destination page, which serves as a form of
	 * identity that can be used to determine if a link is on the same Page that
	 * it links to. When Pages are parameterized, the Link.linksTo() method
	 * should be overridden instead.
	 * <p>
	 * A page's identity is important because links which are on the same page
	 * that they link to often need to be displayed in a different way to
	 * indicate that they are 'disabled' and don't go anywhere. Links can be
	 * manually disabled by calling Link.setDisabled(). Links which have
	 * setAutoEnable(true) will automatically enable or disable themselves
	 * depending on whether or not Link.linksTo() returns true. The default
	 * implementation of PageLink.linksTo() therefore looks like this:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * private final IPageLink pageLink;
	 * 
	 * public boolean linksTo(final Page page)
	 * {
	 * 	return page.getClass() == pageLink.getPageIdentity();
	 * }
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * @return The class of page linked to, as a form of identity
	 * @see Link#linksTo(Page)
