		<section name="Running the Examples Using the Binary Distribution">
			<p>
				The process for running the distribution of the examples is quite simple. All you need is
				a working J2EE application server like Tomcat, JBoss, Jetty, Resin, WebSphere, etc. and the 
				war file from the examples distribution. Basically the process is outlined as follows:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Download the distribution</li>
				<li>Unpack the distribution</li>
				<li>Deploy the <code>war</code> file</li>
				<li>Start your application server</li>
				<li>Start your browser</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				In the following sections each step is described in more detail.
			</p>
			<subsection name="Download the Distribution">
				<p>
					In order to run the examples from the distribution (so you don't have to
					build the examples yourself) you need to
					<a
						href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=119783&amp;package_id=138752">
						download the latest release
					</a>
					from a mirror close to you. After the download you have to unpack
					the archive which will give you
					<ul>
						<li>a <code>war</code> archive,</li>
						<li>a file containing the Apache license</li>
						<li>the source files and</li>
						<li>a directory containing some basic documentation.</li>
					</ul>
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Using an Existing Application Server">
				<p>
					Next you need to copy the <code>war</code>
					archive in your deployment directory of your application server. For example:
				</p>
				<table>
					<tr>
						<th>Server</th>
						<th>Default deployment directory relative to installation</th>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>JBoss</td>
						<td>$(JBOSS_HOME)/server/default/deploy</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Jetty</td>
						<td>$(JETTY_HOME)/webapps</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Tomcat</td>
						<td>${TOMCAT_HOME)/webapps</td>
					</tr>
					<tr>
						<td>Resin</td>
						<td>${RESIN_HOME)/webapps</td>
					</tr>
				</table>
				<p>
					If your application server is not listed here, please consult your manual on how to
					deploy web archives (<code>war</code> files).
				</p>
			</subsection>
			<subsection name="Run the Examples">
				<p>
					If you're done copying, all you need to do is start your application server and
					point your browser to
					<a href="http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples">
						http://localhost:8080/wicket-examples
					</a>
					(this link will not work when the listening port of your application server is
					configured to listen to another port than port
					<code>8080</code>
					).
