				Nothing says more about a development technology than a few simple examples. After
				all, how hard should it be to do something easy? The examples below should speak for
				themselves in demonstrating how easy it is to get things done in Wicket when
				compared to other frameworks. You will discover that Wicket's component-oriented
				structure and its "low touch" approach to HTML is quite inviting.
