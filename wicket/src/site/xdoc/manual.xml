			<p>
				Currently there is no (finished) up to date User's Guide. In this document we
				describe places where you can find any documentation that is available.
				<a href="/wiki/index.php/Newuserguide">Work is in progress</a>
				to build a new, up to date user's guide.
			</p>
			<p>You could consult the following places for information on using Wicket:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
					<a href="QuickTour.html">The examples</a>
					The examples are a showcase of how one might use Wicket. There are examples
					displaying form validation, using Hibernate, Spring, etc. You can see the
					examples in action using the
					<a href="QuickStartBinary.html">binary distribution</a>
					, or the
					<a href="QuickStartSource.html">source distribution</a>
					.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/wiki/index.php/Models">Working with Wicket Models</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/wiki/index.php/Lifecycle">The Lifecycle of a Wicket Application</a>
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/wiki/index.php/Newuserguide">The new User's Guide</a>
					Please consult the
					<a href="/wiki/index.php/Newuserguide">Wiki</a>
					effort for creating a new, up to date user's guide. It is still in its infancy,
					but you will find accurate documentation there.
				</li>
				<li>
					<a href="/apidocs/index.html" target="_blank" class="newwindow">The JavaDoc</a>
					The JavaDoc's are kept up to date religiously, so probably the best information
					can be found there.
				</li>
