How to Build and Run the Demos in 5 Minutes**

1. Download Jetty from http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=7322

2. Unzip Jetty to any folder.  We'll call this folder JETTY_HOME.

3. Go to WICKET_HOME (where this QUICK_START.txt file lives) and type "ant".

   NOTE: Ant 1.6 is REQUIRED.  Any 1.4.x version of Java should work,
         but testing has mainly been on 1.4.2.

4. Copy WICKET_HOME/build/examples/*.war to JETTY_HOME/webapps

5. Go to JETTY_HOME and type "java -jar start.jar"

VOILA!

You have built and are now running all 9 Wicket example applications.

To see each app, go to http://localhost:8080/<exampleName>/
For starters, try http://localhost:8080/HelloWorld/

Enjoy!
