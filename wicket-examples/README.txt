Wicket Examples
===============

To run the Wicket examples, you can just deploy the WAR file found in the root directory: 

copy it to the webapps directory or upload it using your server manager and if your server
wasn't running yet, start it. Now you can look at the examples.

If you feel like building it yourself, you can either use ANT or Maven to build the war file:

ant war

or 

mvn package

All necessary dependencies are available in the lib directory.

Have fun!
