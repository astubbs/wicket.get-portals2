    <p>
	    This page was loaded by a component specific override. You can use that - with care - if you have
	    to implement custom loading strategies that are very local to the component. For instance, a custom
	    component that loads it's template from a database and for which you don't want the application
	    to have to know about it's differing loading resource.

	    Note that while it is great to have this flexiblity, the further away you step from Wicket's default
	    way of doing things the harder it will get to figure out what your application is doing.
