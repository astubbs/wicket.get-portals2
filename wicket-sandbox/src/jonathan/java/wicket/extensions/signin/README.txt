This code does not build right now, but represents a very nice working
sign-in framework that I'm using in Voicetribe stuff.  A few very short
lines of code in VoicetribeWebPage, VoicetribeWebSession and VoicetribeWebApplication
integrate this code with the auth framework.  I would like to contribute
the sign in panel to extensions now that it is really ready for that
and the CookieManager to core, where we can integratet that with cookie 
persistence for form fields (which is just one thing that requires a 
cookie manager).
