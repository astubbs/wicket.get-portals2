			<subsection name="October 30, 2005 - Wicket 1.1 Available">
				<p>
					The Wicket team is proud to announce the availability of Wicket 1.1 for 
					download! Wicket is a Java component oriented web application framework 
					that takes simplicity, separation of concerns and easy of use to a whole 
					new level. Wicket web applications consist of HTML markup and Java 
					classes. No strange languages, no strange markup, no configuration files
					, no specialized, expensive tools: just Java, HTML and you.
				</p>
				<p>
					This Wicket version contains a lot of improvements from the 1.0 version. 
					New features include:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Simplified feedback and validation</b> - enables custom feedback strategies</li>
					<li><b>Live Component Reference</b> - the examples project contains a component reference showing how to use the components.</li>
					<li><b>JavaScript and CSS support for components</b> - contribute JavaScript and CSS from your component to the using page</li>
					<li><b>Markup Inheritance</b> - enables template pages and components</li>
					<li><b>Inclusion of external markup</b></li>
					<li><b>Simplified Choice component</b> - creating drop down, radio and list components was never this easy</li>
					<li><b>Less dependencies</b> - we removed several library dependencies</li>
					<li><b>Customizable Form handling</b> - easy for quick forms, easily enables full custom form processing</li>
					<li><b>Improved resource handling</b></li>
					<li><b>Date picker component</b> - will not get you dates, but a JavaScript and text field enabled localized calendar component.</li>
					<li><b>Improved URL handling</b></li>
					<li><b>AJAX request handling support</b> - support for two leading AJAX JavaScript libraries is available as separate downloads from our Wicket Stuff project: scriptaculous and DOJO toolkit</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The Wicket team wishes to extend their gratitude to the user and 
					developer community for their testing efforts and help, making this 
					release a reality!
				</p>

					following
