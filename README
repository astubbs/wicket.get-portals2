Apache Wicket 1.3
=================

This is the readme file for the Wicket core project. 

Apache Wicket is an open source, java, component based, web application
framework. With proper mark-up/logic separation, a POJO data model, and a
refreshing lack of XML, Apache Wicket makes developing web-apps simple and
enjoyable again. Swap the boilerplate, complex debugging and brittle code for
powerful, reusable components written with plain Java and HTML.

Incubation
----------

The Wicket project is an effort undergoing incubation at the Apache Software
Foundation (ASF), sponsored by the Incubator PMC. Incubation is required of
all newly accepted projects until a further review indicates that the
infrastructure, communications, and decision making process have stabilized in
a manner consistent with other successful ASF projects. While incubation
status is not necessarily a reflection of the completeness or stability of the
code, it does indicate that the project has yet to be fully endorsed by the
ASF.

For more information about the incubation status of the Wicket project you
can go to the following page:

http://incubator.apache.org/projects/wicket.html

License
-------

Wicket is distributed under the terms of the Apache Software Foundation
license, version 2.0. The text is included in the file LICENSE.txt in the root
of the project.

Java/Application server requirements
------------------------------------

Wicket requires at least Java 1.4. The application server for running your web
application should adhere to the servlet specification version 2.3 or newer.
All necessary dependencies are located in the /lib directory of this package.

Getting started
---------------

The Wicket project has several projects where you can learn from, and get
started quickly:

 - wicket-examples:

    shows all components in short usage examples, also available live on:
    http://www.wicketstuff.org/wicket13

 - wicket-quickstart:

    provides a skeleton project for use in NetBeans, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA
    and other major IDE's, without having to configure anything yourself. You
    can copy'n'paste the examples from the website into your pages and see
    them running on your own box.

 - qwicket (http://www.antwerkz.com/qwicket):

    Qwicket is a quickstart application for the wicket framework. Its intent
    is to provide a rapid method for creating a new wicket project with the
    basic infrastructure in place so that you can quickly get to the meat of
    your application rather than mucking with the plumbing of a wicket
    application. Currently, the system only supports spring and hibernate
    built with ant.

 - AppFuse light - Wicket edition (https://appfuse-light.dev.java.net/)

    AppFuse Light is a can all do it all quickstart setup for almost all
    possible permutations for building Java web applications and ORM
    technologies. It features over 60 downloads and combines each available
    web application framework with Hibernate, iBatis, JDO (JPOX), OJB and
    Spring JDBC.

Building Wicket from source
---------------------------

The Wicket distribution contains the final Wicket jar. You can use this
directly in your applications. The Wicket project also uploads the source-jars
and JavaDoc jars together with the final jar to the Maven repository used by
the Maven build tool. So there is actually no specific need to build Wicket
yourself from the distribution.

Building using maven 2, change the working directory to src and either do:

 - mvn package

    creates wicket-x.y.z.jar in target/ subdirectory.

 - mvn install

    creates wicket-x.y.z.jar in target/ subdirectory and installs the file
    into your local repository for use in other projects.

Migrating from 1.2
------------------

There is a migration guide available on our Wiki:
