/**
 * Represents a service locator for lazy init proxies. When the first method
 * invocation occurs on the lazy init proxy this locator will be used to
 * retrieve the proxy target object that will receive the method invocation.
 * <p>
 * Generally implementations should be small when serialized because the main
 * purpose of lazy init proxies is to be stored in session when the wicket pages
 * are serialized, and when deserialized to be able to lookup the dependency
 * again. The smaller the implementation of IProxyTargetLocator the less the
 * drain on session size.
 * <p>
 * A small implementation may use a static lookup to retrieve the target object.
 * <p>
 * Example:
 * 
 * <pre>
 * class UserServiceLocator implements IProxyTargetLocator
 * {
 * 	Object locateProxyObject()
 * 	{
 * 		MyApplication app = (MyApplication) Application.get();
 * 		return app.getUserService();
 * 	}
 * }
 * </pre>
 * 
 * @see LazyInitProxyFactory#createProxy(Class, IProxyTargetLocator)
