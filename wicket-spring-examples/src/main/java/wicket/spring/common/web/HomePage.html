<wicket:extend>
This examples project demonstrates two jdk 1.4 compliant ways to integrate wicket and spring.
<br/><br/>
<a href="#" wicket:id="direct-link">direct approach</a>
<br/>
This is the simplest of approaches. All necessary spring beans are looked up via static lookups into the ExampleApplication class.
<br/><br/>
<a href="#" wicket:id="proxy-link">proxy approach</a>
<br/>
This approach wraps the static lookups for dependencies inside dynamic proxies. This allows the code to be decoupled from the application and easy to unit test.
