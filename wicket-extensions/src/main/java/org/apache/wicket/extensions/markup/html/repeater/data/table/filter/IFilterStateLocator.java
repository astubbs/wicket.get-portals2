/**
 * Locator that locates the object that represents the state of the filter. Usually it is convenient
 * to let the data provider object implement this interface so that the data provider can be itself
 * used to locate the filter state object. This also makes it easy for the data provider to locate
 * the filter state which it will most likely need to filter the data.
 * <p>
 * Example
 * 
 * <pre>
 *    class UserDataProvider extends SortableDataProvider implements IFilterStateLocator {
 *      private User filterBean=new User;
 *      
 *      public getFilterState() { return filterBean; }
 *      public setFilterState(Object o) { filterBean=(User)o; }
 *      
 *      public Iterator iterate(int start, int count) {
 *        getUserDao().find(start, count, filterBean);
 *      }
 *    }
 * </pre>
