<p>
This package contains a panel based implementation of bread crumb participants.
Basically, if you use <tt>BreadCrumbPanel</tt> with <tt>BreadCrumbBar</tt>, you'll
have a working pattern of panel replacements and bread crumbs that keep track of them.
See the breadcrumb example of wicket-examples.
