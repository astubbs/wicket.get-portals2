            <para>Any web application of significant size will face the issue 
                of providing an easy way for users to navigate its many pages. 
                Typically, this is accomplished by providing graphics and links 
                which surround the main text of the page. These groups of links 
                are called "navigations" and they most commonly have the 
                appearance of tabs or links across the top of the page, or 
                links along one side of the page (sometimes arranged in a tree 
                structure). This chapter shows you how to implement navigations 
                in Wicket.</para>
